# kunstnetz
*kunstnetz* is the online component of the Kunstharz game. It provides services to host games and facilitate communication between players.

# Limitations
kunstharz is designed for matching two-player games.

# Strategies
kunstnetz tries to facilitate direct communcation between players. If that does not work, it serves as a relay and
routes traffic between the players.

# Nice-to-have
This is not implemented yet:

* relay communication
* direct communication with nat traversal
* password protected rooms
* matching by skill and approximated lag
